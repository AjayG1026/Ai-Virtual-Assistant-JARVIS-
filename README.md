# Ai-Virtual-Assistant-JARVIS-
The AI Virtual Voice Assistant, named JARVIS, is a Python-based project that demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) to create a voice-driven interface for user interaction. 
<br>
The assistant bridges the gap between human language and machine understanding by leveraging speech recognition, machine learning, and text-to-speech synthesis. This project showcases how technology can facilitate a hands-free and user-friendly experience, making everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. The primary functionality of JARVIS includes recognizing spoken commands, classifying them into predefined categories, and executing tasks such as responding to greetings, providing the current time, opening websites (e.g., YouTube), and telling jokes. Using scikit-learn, the assistant employs a pipeline with TfidfVectorizer and Logistic Regression to classify text-based user commands into actionable outputs. Speech recognition is handled using the speech_recognition library, while the pyttsx3 library provides realistic voice output for text-to-speech conversion.
